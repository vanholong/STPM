# README for the Mining Seasonal Temporal Patterns in Big Time Series

## Paper abstract
Very large time series are increasingly available from an ever wider range of IoT-enabled sensors, from which significant insights can be obtained through mining temporal patterns from them. A useful type of patterns found in many real-world applications exhibits periodic occurrences, and is thus called seasonal temporal pattern (STP). Compared to regular patterns, mining seasonal temporal patterns is more challenging since traditional measures such as support and confidence do not capture the seasonality characteristics. Further, the anti-monotonicity property does not hold for STPs, and thus, resulting in an exponential search space. This paper presents our Frequent Seasonal Temporal Pattern Mining from Time Series (FreqSTPfTS) solution providing: (1) The first solution for seasonal temporal pattern mining (STPM) from time series that can mine STP at different data granularities. (2) The STPM algorithm that uses efficient data structures and two pruning techniques to reduce the search space and speed up the mining process. (3) An approximate version of STPM that uses mutual information, a measure of data correlation, to prune unpromising time series from the search space. (4) An extensive experimental evaluation showing that STPM outperforms the baseline in runtime and memory consumption, and can scale to big datasets. The approximate STPM is up to an order of magnitude faster and less memory consuming than the baseline, while maintaining high accuracy.

## To run E-STPM 
python3 ESTPM.py -i path_input -o path_output -maxper maxPeriod_threshold -minden minDensity_threshold -minsr minSeason_threshold -e epsilon -mindist minDistance -maxdist maxDistance -mps max_patternLength

path_input: path of sequence database  
path_output: path of folder contains output  
maxPeriod_threshold: the maximum period threshold
minDensity_threshold: the minimum density threshold
minSeason_threshold: the minimum season threshold
epsilon: the epsilon value
minDistance: the minimum distance
maxDistance: the maximum distance
max_patternLength: the maximum length of a pattern

Example: python3 ESTPM.py -i data/SequenceDBRE.csv -o result/ -maxper 8 -minden 7 -minsr 8 -e 4 -mindist 90 -maxdist 270 -mps 3

## To run A-STPM
### 1. Compute Mutual Information
python3 MI.py -i path_input -o path_output

path_input: path of symbolic database
path_output: path of output file contains MI values

Example: python3 MI.py -i data/SymbolicDBRE.csv -o MIResult/MI

### 2. Compute mu values for each pair of minSeason and minDensity
python3 MU.py -i path_input -o path_output -s season_threshold -d density_threshold -n sequenceDB_size

path_input: path of symbolic database
path_output: path of output file contains MU values corresponding with the minSeason and minDensity thresholds
season_threshold: the minimum season threshold
density_threshold: the minimum density threshold
sequenceDB_size: the size of the sequence database

Example: python3 MU.py -i data/SymbolicDBRE.csv -o MUResult/MU -s 8 -d 7 -n 1460

### 3. Run approximate STPM
python3 ASTPM.py -i path_input -o path_output -imi path_MI -imu path_MU -maxper maxPeriod_threshold -minden minDensity_threshold -minsr minSeason_threshold -e epsilon -mindist minDistance -maxdist maxDistance -mps max_patternLength

path_input: path of sequence database
path_output: path of folder contains output
path_MI: path of file MI
path_MU: path of file MU
maxPeriod_threshold: the maximum period threshold
minDensity_threshold: the minimum density threshold
minSeason_threshold: the minimum season threshold
epsilon: the epsilon value
minDistance: the minimum distance
maxDistance: the maximum distance
max_patternLength: the maximum length of a pattern

Example: python3 ASTPM.py -i data/SequenceDBRE.csv -o result/ -imi MIResult/MI -imu MUResult/MU -maxper 8 -minden 7 -minsr 8 -e 4 -mindist 90 -maxdist 270 -mps 3
